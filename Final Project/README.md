Final project submission for the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021

Project idea:
TLDR: Validation of athletes in races.

LONGER VERSION: More and more people start running, either to improve their health or to reach their personal goal. 
There are plenty of short and long distances races, inside the cities or in the mountains. Athletes, usually have to pay for their participation, receive racing staff (shirts, medals, sport drinks etc), 
take their race certificate and medal as well as have other services (photos, videos, running time etc).

CONCEPT: The interface has 2 modes:

- one for registering all the necessary information
- one for validating them

BENEFITS:
- Trust: There is a huge database in every race with sensitively information. Blockchain will help for the solvency of the system.
- Automation: The athlete will be able to verify the services that paid for and wants, with QR code.
- Certificate: The athlete will be able to receive a token or an NFT for the participation and the position. 

REGISTERING: As soon as the athletes have entered all the necessary information (personal info, pay for the participation and select the services they want), 
they will receive their QR code and enter it in the Blockchain.

CONFIRMING: In the race day, through athlete's QR code, the organizer will be able to see if all the needs have been covered or if something is still pending.
